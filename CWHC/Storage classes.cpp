/*
There are four types of storage classe
AUTO: variable formed in a function and whose storage class has not been defined.
    Can only be acessed in the function.
    Garbage value as default
    Lifetime that of the funcion
    eg auto int x;

EXTERNAL: defined outside function
    can be used inside any funciton
    Default value is 0
    Life for whole program
    eg- extern int a;

STATIC: intialized inside a function
    scope is limited to the function
    Default value is 0
    Life for whole program
    eg- static a;

REGISTER: similar to auto
    limited to the function defined in,
    default value is 0,
    it uses memory of cpu instead of local memory
    eg- register int a;
